## Brief Description

### Shadcn Library used for light box effect on thumbnail images
```bash

I was a bit confused about what to implement at first.
The instructions said to design a blog according to a Figma link,
but the Figma link showed that the blog section didn't contain images while the work section did.

Here's what I did:

1)Implemented a lightbox and hover effect on the items in the work section.
2)Added a hover effect on the items in the blog section.
3)Implemented search functionality for both the blog and work sections.
4)Lastly, implemented a dark mode for the entire application.
```
